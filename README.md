FIWAREHub was released as a dissertation for my academic studies.
It serves the purpose of creating a FIWARE ecosystem in order to analyze big data.
In my case, FIWARE IoT agents were provisioned as a simulation layer for big data, fed from a dataset store.
The data was later imported into a SQL Database and analyzed further via the use of Business Intelligence software.
